		<p>For the first time ever, college football will have a playoff system that will determine the National Champion! It's only 4 teams, 
			 but it's everything we've wanted as college football fans. And if I'm throwing my 2 cents in, 4 teams is perfect. The bowl season 
			 is fun; teams get geared up for bowl games, we like them as fans, and because....football. But there has never been a clear cut way
			 to determine the National Champion. Don't get me wrong; most of the time the trophy is handed to the best team in the country. But
			 controversy has not been lost when it comes to deciding which team prevails over all others. The polls have long been a system that 
			 uses biased opinions to rank college football teams, in turn selecting 1 team that sits at the top after all games have been played.
			 Obviously not the best way to decide the NC, as the '97 Cornhuskers had to split with another team. The NCAA eventually came up with
			 a ranking system that combined the polls and computer math to select the top 10 teams in the nation; this system is known as the BCS.
			 Still junk. It didn't do anything but (maybe) pit the top 2 teams against each other, while hyper-glorifying the other 8 teams
			 (and subsequent bowl games). It helped a little, but the system had a ton of flaws, many of which were exploited to an extent that hurt
			 the quality of the game. Subtle changes have been made over the years, but the end result has been the possiblity of a playoff....and
			 it's finally here! If only this could have happened last year; the "NO FLY ZONE" Spartans of MSU against the eventual champs of FSU.
			 What could have been...Oh well, roses will do for now.</p>
			 <p>Okay, so here's the deal - we obviously can't pick the National Champion before the first bowl game (when picks are due). We won't 
			 know that matchup until the end of New Years Day, after the Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl. But of course I want to include the playoff in 
			 some way. So here's my preliminary idea:
				<ul>
					<li>Pick every game like we always have, including Rose and Sugar</li>
					<li>Side pot, or additional game/pool, for those that want to put $ on playoff</li>
				</ul>
			Not everyone has to do the additional pool. However, it does need to be separate from the main one, but still related. If this doesn't make 
			sense, keep reading.</p>
			<p>My first thought was "How can we include the playoff in the Bowl Pool"?.....My answer-->>>Can't do it. At least not in the way we've 
			always done this pool. All picks are submitted before the first game, no changes. That's because the bowl games don't change. Your picks
			don't change. Win is a win, loss is a loss, 1's and 0's. But there's that playoff...no idea which 2 will play on Jan 12.........</p>
			<p>So here's what I'm thinking - a confidence style pool for the playoff. Not for the 3 games of the playoff, but the 30 games leading
			up to it. Yep, every winner of each game leading up to the Rose Bowl, ranking each pick 1-30, no duplicates. Games after Jan 1 
			will not be included. The idea is to use the confidence points you've gained (or won) to "bet" on the 4 playoff team bracket. Put a set number of points 
			on a team, and if they win you keep those points; if they lose, those points are gone. Total points available is 465 (I think). There will be 
			4 teams in the playoff, 2 of those teams will move on, and 1 will stand tall. This results in 7 spots to put your points. The Player with 
			the most points after NC game wins the side pot $. This is all preliminary; I'd like some feedback on what you guys think. First year 
			might even be a trial run to test it, no $ involved.</p>
			<p>Quick rundown on how it might work:
				<ul>
					<li>Make your confidence picks for each game played before the Rose Bowl (30 games)
						<ul><li>This may need to be changed to the day before.</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>Take the confidence points you've accumulated/won, and "bet" those points on each of the 4 playoff teams. You keep the points from 
					the 2 teams that win (if you had any points on either of those teams), so confidence matters again. The points you wagered on the losing team are lost.</li>
					<li>Take your remaining points and wager them on the remaining 2 teams playing in the NC. How much you wager on either team is completely 
					up to you; you can put all or some on either team. Split it in half if you want, or put 1 point on the favorite if no one has any points 
					left. The goal is to have the most points left after the NC game.</li>
					<li>Remember that this is separate from the main Bowl Pool in terms of money, but your success in the main Bowl Pool gives you an advantage 
					in the side pool based on your confidence points.</li>
					<li>Player with most points after NC games wins the pot</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				When it comes down to it, the two pools will be completely separate from each other. Some may want to do one and not the other. I may put 
				out the feelers or maybe take a poll on what people think they would do. Also, entry for the Pick 'Em will stay at $10, but I'm also looking 
				for feedback on what the entry for Confidence should be. No bundle deal since that's unfair for the people that pay full price for only one pool.
				<ul>
					<li>Pick 'Em only</li>
					<li>Confidence only</li>
					<li>Both Pools</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>&#60;5</li>
					<li>5</li>
					<li>10</li>
				</ul>
